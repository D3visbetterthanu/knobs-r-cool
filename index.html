        <h1> A HISTORY ON DOORKNOBS.</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>
        Doorknobs have been used by humans as early as the late stone age between 10,000 to 4,500 BCE. The first doorknob with a key was used in egyptian times. The key lock
        door handle was also used in Roman times, but they were basiclly useless, because usually someone occupied he house. They used the normal no-lock door knob though, 
        as archaeologists found door knobs resmbeling ours as late as 1st Century CE. In the middle ages, blacksmiths designed a special doorknob in which you slide a pin
        through the door, and then in opened. In the 1600s, drop handles(the doorknob when you grab and pull down) were being replaced by push handles. The name was self-explainatory. 
        You grab the handle, and then you push. Knobs with keys were being used again, but they were only for expensive buildings with rich owners. In the industrial revelution, people
        starting finding more metals like steel and brass. Because of this, doorknobs became cheaper to manufacture. Then we started making the same doorknobs we would use today.
        By a lot, Europe made the most doorknobs. America imported 85-90% of its doorknobs, so everyone starting making their own doorknob companys. Not long after, doorknob production
        in the U.S. was skyrocketing. By the mid 20th century, almost every modern home in the world has doorknobs inside of it. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, doors have evolved into using
        foot operated handles and doors opend by your forearm. The history of doorknobs is intreresting, more interesting than you think. And yes, I did write this.
